                 world (36,000+).",

    history: "The siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street
    
              at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at 34.1255°N 117.2946°W) but it was not the
              
              McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers' business to modernize it. The
              
              brothers introduced the "Speedee Service System" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of
              
              the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than 
              
              two decades earlier.[citation needed] The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a
              
              hamburger who was referred to as "Speedee". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the
              
              universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, 
              
              appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.

              On May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name "McDonald's" with the 
              
              description "Drive-In Restaurant Services", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, McDonald's,
              
              under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, double-arched 
              
              "M" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used a single arch for the architecture of their
              
              buildings. Although the "Golden Arches" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used
              
              until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.
    
              The present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955.
              
              This was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall, although this location was destroyed
              
              and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the
              
              company's worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the 
              
              McDonald brothers out of the industry.
    
              Kroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's 
              
              autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo)
              
              and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the
              
              Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum.[16] With the expansion of McDonald's into many
              
              international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American 
              
              way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate
              
              ethics, and consumer responsibility.",

    factsAndFigures: "McDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve
    
                      68 million customers each day.[17][18] McDonald's operates 37,855 restaurants worldwide, 
                      
                      employing more than 210,000 people as of the end of 2018.[10][11][17] There are currently a 
                      
                      total of 2,770 company-owned locations and 35,085 franchised locations, which includes 21,685 
                      
                      locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 7,225 locations licensed to developmental 
                      
                      licensees, and 6,175 locations licensed to foreign affiliates.

                      Focusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired 
                      
                      during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 
                      
                      2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange.[19][20] Until 
                      
                      December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999
                      
                      to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.
    
                     Notably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years,[22] making it
                     
                     one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. The company is ranked 131st on the Fortune 500 of the 
                     
                     largest United States corporations by revenue.[25] In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the
                     
                     first time in nine years.[26] In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen 
                     
                     years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.
    
                     In the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales. McDonald's 
                     
                     closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to 
                     
                     open. This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations
                     
                     in the United States since 1970.",

                    its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010
                    
                    and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period.In recent 
                    
                    times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate 
                    
                    investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this 
                    
                    would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too 
                    
                    large a risk to the company's business model.

                    The United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30
                    
                    percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company.

                    According to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. 
                    
                    have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to

                    annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction.[49] Fast Food Nation also states 
                    
                    that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single
                    
                    largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies
                    
                    to some extent based on the culture of the host country",

                      "McDonaldization" of society. The Economist newspaper uses the "Big Mac Index": the comparison
                      
                      of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies'

                      while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India[54][55] (albeit for a Maharaja Mac—the 
                        
                      next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).

                     McDonald's, Paulista Avenue, São Paulo, Brazil  Thomas Friedman once said that no country
    
                     with a McDonald's had gone to war with another.[57][58] However, the "Golden Arches Theory of
                     
                     Conflict Prevention" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of
                     
                     Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war.
                     
                     McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the 
                     
                     region in 2014. On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained 
                     
                     over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut 
                     
                     down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia
                     
                     since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country. On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy 
                     
                     Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion 
                     
                     that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.
    
                     McDonald's, Old Mahabalipuram Road, Chennai, India Some observers have suggested that the company
   
                    should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group 
                    
                    of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East[62] looked at the impact McDonald's had 
                    
                    on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the 
                    
                    first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other
                    
                    restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest 
                    
                    oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of
                    
                    personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants.[63] McDonald's has opened a McDonald's 
                    
                    restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.

                    restaurant in India by mid-2013.[65] Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception

                    of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in

                    On January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold
                    
                    for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by 
                    
                    CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed

                    On April 1, 2019 Nations Restaurant News reported that McDonald’s made a rare choice, spending 
                    
                    $3.7 million to invest in Plexure (a New Zealand app developer). Which makes this investment a

    products: "McDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French 
    
               fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and
               
               vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib
               
               sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.

               Products are offered as either "dine-in" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or 
               
               "take-out" (where the customer opts to take the food off the premises). "Dine-in" meals are provided
               
               on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. "Take-out" meals are usually delivered

               individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.
    
               Since Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the
              
               United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options,
              
               and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial
              
               preservatives from Chicken McNuggets,[70] replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found
              
               in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.
    
               In September 2018, McDonald's USA announced that they no longer use artificial preservatives, flavors

             2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In

           major redesign since the 1970s.

           The goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes 
           
           wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was 
           
           shifted to golden for a more "sunny" look, and olive and sage green were also added.

           To create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging
           
           lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other 
           
           upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber 
           
           glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature "semi-swooshes"

    automation: "Since the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which 
    
                 would perform actions such as taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested 
                 
                 "E-Clerks" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to 
                 
                 "save money on live staffers" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.

                  In 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% 
                  
                 probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments. By 
                 
                 2016, McDonalds Create Your Taste electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally 
                 
                 where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s,
                 
                 some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for 
                 
                 employing individuals.", 
                 
      wages: "On August 5, 2013, The Guardian revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour
      
              contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country.[100] A study 
              
              released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84
              
              percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their 
              
              legal wages by their employers.

              From 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance
              
              annually resulting from receiving low wages.[102] The McResource website advised employees to break 
              
              their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell 
              
              possessions online for quick cash, and to "quit complaining" as "stress hormone levels rise by 15 
              
              percent after ten minutes of complaining."[103] In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource
              
              website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone
              
              help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.
      
              Liberal think tank, the Roosevelt Institute, accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying 
              
              less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft.[105] In South Korea, 
              
              McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary 
              
              schedules adjustments and pay delays.[106] In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by 
              
              Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an
              
              hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34

              Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.[108] His total compensation for 2017 was
              
              $21,761,052.",  
              
    strikes: "McDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike

              Rensi stated: "It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient
              
              making $15 an hour bagging french fries" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly 
              
              take away from entry-level jobs.[111] However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for 
              
              workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first 
              
              quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.

              In September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero-hours contracts for 
              
              staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was

                        of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The 
                        
                        complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by

                          the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of

                          company's advertising strategy.[122] To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in
                          
                          United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and

criticism: "In 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international 
    
            group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled What's wrong with McDonald's?, criticizing its 
            
            environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and
            
            apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the 
            
            longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several
            
            countries.

           In the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of
           
           43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's 
           
           menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their 
           
           french fries.

           Though the company objected, the term "McJob" was added to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 
           
           2003.[131] The term was defined as a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little
           
           opportunity for advancement.

           In 2001, Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's
           
           . Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food
            
            industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the 
            
            social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques
            
            in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on
            
            McDonald's.

            In 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting 
            
            its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.

            Morgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film Super Size Me claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to
            
            the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information 
            
            about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was 
            
            eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal. There was also a documentary 
            
            called Fat Head which pointed out inconsistencies in Super Size Me.

            In 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Video Game by Italian group Molleindustria was released online. It 
            
            is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business
           
            simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to 
            
            e controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting 
            
            public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.

           In January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to 
           
           avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters 
           
           in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, "McDonald's firmly denies the accusation
           
           made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France",

                    retailer for its valued customers. With a strong believe in the phrase "when it's green it's
